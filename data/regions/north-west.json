        "question": "Is this a fully licensed service?",
        "answer": "No, we are not authorised or regulated by the Financial Conduct Authority. We provide general price information and analytical support only—we do not offer financial advice, funeral planning services, or any regulated activities. All decisions regarding funeral arrangements remain entirely yours. For personalised support, we recommend consulting with qualified professionals such as solicitors or financial advisers."
      },
      {
        "question": "Do you receive commissions from funeral directors?",
        "answer": "Absolutely not. We maintain complete independence and receive no commissions, referral fees, or payments of any kind from funeral directors, crematoria, or any service providers. Our sole revenue comes from the optional £49 premium reports. This independence ensures our information remains unbiased and focused solely on helping families explore their options."
      },
      {
        "question": "How accurate is your data?",
        "answer": "Very accurate. We base all calculations on official CMA Standardised Price Lists that funeral directors must publish by law. We analyse 320 North West England providers and update data weekly. Our 2025 data incorporates the latest regional pricing showing North West funerals averaging £4,297 after a 13% increase."
      },
      {
        "question": "Why have North West funeral costs risen so sharply?",
        "answer": "North West England saw the highest UK increase (13%) in 2024-2025, jumping from 9th to 4th most expensive region. Funeral directors attribute this to rising crematoria fees and wage increases. Despite this, the region still offers significant savings opportunities through provider comparison and timing optimisation."
